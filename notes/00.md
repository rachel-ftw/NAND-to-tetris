### Reading Notes

> The true voyage of discovery consists not of going to new places, but of having a new pair of eyes.
> â€”Marcel Proust (1871â€“1922)

Learning 3 things

- how computers work
- how to break down comples problems into manageable modules
- how to develop larg-scale hardware and software systems.

What does it take to actually run a program?
A program is nothing more than dead characters stored in a text file. First we must parse to find semantis, then convert it to a low level language understood by the machine. _compilation_ is that translation process, the result of which is another text file with machine readable code.

machine language is also an abstraction - a set of binary codes.
it must be read, implemented, by some _hardware architecture_.
which must be implemented by a _chip set_ (registers, memory units, ALU, etc)
which must be implemented by hardware devices made of integrated _elementary logic gates_
which are built from primitive gates like _Nand_ or _Nor_
each gate is built of _switching devices_ implemented by transistors
and past this we get into physics... ðŸ˜‚

_Abstraction_ - generally a mental expression that seeks to separate in thouht and capture in some concise manner the essence of some entity. in CS it's: finding out "what the entity does" and ignoring the details of "how it does it". must capture all that needs to be known in order to use the entity's services, nothing more.
abstraction = interface

this course uses a bottom-up aproach, begin with the most elementary and move up through the high abstraction.
Highest: write and run high level programs
mid: hardware land, translating high level programs to machine language
low: how the hardware is actually constructed.

**High Level Language Land**
Where I live at work as a node developer.
take for granted two tools of the trade: the language you work in and the rich library of services that support it.
for example `do Output.printString("Hello World")` which calls the service for printing strings... but where is that implemented (usually jointly by host operating system and standard library)
by the end of the course we will write an OS in Jack, an object based language that shows key engineering principals underlying design and implementation of languages like Java and C#.

**The Road To Hardware Land**
all high level must be translated into machine language for a target computer platform. compilation is broken down into several layers of abstraction: compiler, virtual machine implementation, & assembely.

translation of the compiler has two conceptual stages: syntax analysis and code generation. source text is analyzed & grouped into language constructs kept in a data structure called "parse tree" (AST? same??) -- these tasks are known as syntax analysis.
the parse tree can be recursively walked yields a program written in "intermediate language" that describes a sequence of generic steps operating on a stack-based VM - output is a large assembly program, which needs to be translated into binary.

**Hardware Land**
the point at which software meets hardware.
We will be using Hack, a general purpose computer system that strikes balance between simplicity & power.
Will be building on simulations.

> We deliberate not about ends, but about means. For a doctor does not deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall persuade . . .
> They assume the end and consider how and by what means it is attained, and if it seems easily and best produced thereby; while if it is achieved _by other means_, they consider how it will be achieved and by what means _this_ will be achieved, until they come to the first cause . . .
> and what is last in the order of analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming. (Aristotles, Nicomachean Ethics, Book III, 3, 1112b)

**0.0**
Professor name: Shimon Schocken & Noam Nisan
7 weeks, 6 projects, 1 computer
![overview]('./img/00-00-overview.png')

**0.1** the road ahead
how do programs do anything? how do letters on the screen turn into actions?
at a begining level, you don't have to worry about the "how" now the "what"
the how is implementation. the what is abstraction (which is what our programming languages do).
abstraction is really helpful becasue I can think about something and solve a problem, but that I'm allowed to forget about that complexity and just build atop the previous blocks.

**0.2** From nand to hack
not going into electrical engineering, but instead using the most basic computer unit: nand.
How do you build a chip? Modern hardware designers use a hardware simulator.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- After installing JAVA I can run `.sh` files directly in terminal, like `./nand2tetris/from-coursera/tools/HardwareSimulator.sh`
